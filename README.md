# MapReduce

MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. After reading ["MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters"] I wanted try writing minimal implementation of "Count of URL Access Frequency" ([https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf))

## Minimal requirements
